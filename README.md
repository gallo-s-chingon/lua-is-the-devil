# Does anyone really read this?

well, this is my public NeoVim repository. I don't know what else to put here, but it's here. I'm just a script kiddie prose writer and for some dumb reason I keep trying to write my novel in a terminal modal editor. I've bounced around from vim, NeoVim, emacs (less than a day), kakoune, helix, Doom emacs. GUI editors like notion, obsidian, day one, TextWrangler, Scrivner, Final Draft,  and back to NeoVim a few times inbetween. 

  I've even bounced around filetypes, LaTeX, markdown, fountain, org, neorg (I really wanted to make it work with norg), org-roam.

Finally I've settled on NeoVim. I love it. now I'm going to dial in the plugins to make it work. After playing around with OVIwriter, lunarvim, spacevim, lazyVim, kickstarter, ðŸ¤” there's a few more distros I've tried. But now I'm settled on what plugins i need to write, plus the ones I need to help me ~~configure~~ cobble together the writing environment I wantâ€¦ and then I'll have no more excuses to finish my novel.
